## Commit Message Convention

In this project, we follow a set of rules for our commit messages to make it easier to track changes and release new versions. Here's how it works:

- fix: Use this type when your commit fixes a bug. This corresponds to a PATCH in semantic versioning.

- feat: Use this type when your commit introduces a new feature. This corresponds to a MINOR in semantic versioning.

- BREAKING CHANGE: Start your commit message with BREAKING CHANGE: if the commit introduces a change that breaks the API. This corresponds to a MAJOR in semantic versioning. This can be part of any type of commit.

- chore: This is used for routine tasks and updates that don't change the codebase, like updating dependencies.

- docs: Use this when you have made changes to documentation.

- style: This denotes changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (like formatting changes, missing semi-colons, etc).

- refactor: Use this when you've made code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.

- perf: This indicates a code change that improves performance.
